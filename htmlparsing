here’s the Critical Rendering Path (CRP) explained step-by-step in very simple words.

You ask for a page
You type a URL or click a link. The browser starts the process to get that page.

Find the server (DNS) & open connection
Browser asks “what IP is this site?” (DNS), then opens a network connection (TCP) and does the secure handshake (TLS) if needed.

Request the HTML
Browser sends an HTTP request to the server. Server sends back the page’s HTML.

Start parsing HTML → build the DOM
The browser reads the HTML text and builds a tree of nodes called the DOM (Document Object Model). Think of the DOM as the page’s structure: tags become nodes.

Download and parse CSS → build the CSSOM
While parsing HTML, the browser finds <link> and <style> and downloads/parses CSS into the CSSOM (CSS Object Model) — a map of style rules.

Handle JavaScript
If the HTML includes scripts, the browser may pause building the DOM until the script is downloaded and run (because scripts can change the DOM/CSS). defer and async change that behaviour. JS can read/modify DOM or styles.

Build the Render Tree
The browser combines the DOM + CSSOM into a render tree — it decides which elements are visible and what styles apply. Invisible elements (like display: none) are omitted.

Layout (a.k.a. reflow)
The browser calculates the exact position and size for each render-tree node — where boxes go on the page. This is called layout.

Paint
The browser paints each element into layers — turns the layout into pixels (colors, text, shadows, images).

Composite
The browser combines those layers (often using the GPU) and shows the final image on your screen.

Interactive
After painting, event handlers, animations and further JS can change the DOM/CSS — which may trigger repaints or reflows for parts of the page.
